# Plans

Plans are the core of Dayopt's timeboxing approach. A Plan represents something you intend to do — whether it's a meeting, a focused work session, or a personal task. By placing Plans on your calendar, you practice timeboxing: allocating specific time blocks to each task.

## Creating a Plan

There are several ways to create a Plan:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Click on the calendar** | Click any empty time slot to open the Inspector |
| **Drag on the calendar** | Click and drag across a time range to pre-fill the start and end time |
| **Right-click** | Right-click an empty area and select "New Plan" |
| **"+" button** | Click the "+" button — Dayopt automatically finds the next available 1-hour slot |
| **Keyboard shortcut** | Press `N` to create a new Plan at the current time |

Once created, fill in the title, adjust the time, add tags, and press `Cmd+Enter` (or `Ctrl+Enter`) to save.

## Editing a Plan

Click any Plan on the calendar or in the sidebar to open the **Inspector** — a detail panel where you can edit all fields:

- **Title** — saves automatically as you type
- **Date** — move the Plan to a different date
- **Start / End time** — adjust the time slot (duration is shown automatically)
- **Tags** — add or remove tags to categorize your Plan
- **Note** — add a rich text description
- **Recurrence** — set the Plan to repeat (see below)
- **Reminder** — get notified before the Plan starts

Use `Arrow Up` / `k` and `Arrow Down` / `j` to navigate between Plans without closing the Inspector.

## Drag and Drop

Plans on the calendar support intuitive drag and drop:

- **Move** — drag a Plan to a different time slot
- **Resize** — drag the bottom edge to change the end time
- **Schedule** — drag an unscheduled Plan from the sidebar onto the calendar

Press `Escape` during a drag to cancel.

## Recurring Plans

Set up Plans that repeat automatically. Click the repeat icon in the Inspector to choose from quick presets:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Every day** | Daily standup |
| **Every week** | Weekly review |
| **Weekdays (Mon-Fri)** | Morning routine |
| **Every month** | Monthly report |
| **Every year** | Annual review |

For more control, select **Custom** to configure:

- Frequency and interval (e.g., every 2 weeks)
- Specific days of the week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- End condition: never, until a date, or after N occurrences

When editing a recurring Plan, you can choose to change:

- **This instance only** — just this one occurrence
- **This and future** — this and all upcoming occurrences
- **All instances** — the entire series

## Completing a Plan

When you finish a task, mark the Plan as complete:

- Click the **checkbox** on the Plan card directly
- Or open the Inspector and click **"Mark as complete"**

You can also use **"Complete + Create Record"** to mark the Plan done and simultaneously create a Record with the same title, time, and tags — linking your intention to your actual time spent.

## Reminders

Set a reminder to get notified before a Plan starts:

| Option | When |
|--------|------|
| At start time | When the Plan begins |
| 10 minutes before | Quick heads-up |
| 30 minutes before | Time to prepare |
| 1 hour before | Advance notice |
| 1 day before | Day-ahead reminder |
| 1 week before | Week-ahead reminder |

## Copy and Paste

Copy a Plan from the right-click menu or with `Cmd+C`, then paste it at any position on the calendar with `Cmd+V`. The pasted Plan keeps the same title, duration, and tags.

## Plan List Panel

Toggle the sidebar panel from the header to see all your Plans in a list view. The panel supports:

- **Search** by title
- **Filter** by status (open / closed), schedule (scheduled / unscheduled), tags
- **Sort** by created date, updated date, or title
- **Group** by tags or status

Drag a Plan card from the list onto the calendar to schedule it.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `N` | Create a new Plan |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Save the Plan |
| `Escape` | Close the Inspector / cancel drag |
| `Arrow Up` or `k` | Previous Plan |
| `Arrow Down` or `j` | Next Plan |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + V` | Paste a copied Plan |
