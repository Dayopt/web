# What is Dayopt?

Dayopt is a **time management and self-awareness tool** for individuals. It combines three core capabilities in one place:

1. **Plan** — Schedule your tasks using timeboxing
2. **Track** — Record how you actually spend your time
3. **Reflect** — Analyze the gap between planned and actual time

Unlike traditional task managers that focus on what you need to do, Dayopt focuses on **when and how long** — helping you build a realistic relationship with time.

## Core Concept: Timeboxing

Timeboxing is the practice of assigning a fixed time block to each task before you start working on it. Instead of an open-ended to-do list, you decide:

- **What** to work on
- **When** to start
- **How long** to spend on it

Research shows that timeboxing is one of the most effective productivity methods. Dayopt makes it easy to practice by combining your calendar with your task list.

## How Dayopt Works

### 1. Create Plans

Plans are your scheduled intentions. Each plan has a title, start time, end time, and optional tags for categorization.

- Drag on the calendar to create a plan
- Set recurring plans for daily or weekly routines
- Organize with hierarchical tags (e.g., Work > Meetings)

### 2. Record Actual Time

Records capture what you actually did. After completing a task, log a record with the actual start and end times.

- Create records manually or from completed plans
- Rate your fulfillment (how satisfied you were with the time spent)
- Compare planned vs. actual time

### 3. Review and Reflect

The Stats dashboard shows you patterns in how you use your time.

- Heatmap of daily activity levels
- Time breakdown by tag
- Planned vs. actual comparison
- Weekly and monthly trends
