# v0.16.0 - Recurrence Refactoring & Inspector Improvements

## Improvements

- **Recurrence scope handling unified** — Scope branching and composite ID logic for recurring plans have been consolidated into a single module, making recurring plan edits more reliable
- **Recurrence ID parsing unified** — ID parsing logic standardized with additional test coverage and i18n support for the RecurrenceDialog
- **Cmd+Enter submit shortcut** — Unified Cmd+Enter (Ctrl+Enter) keyboard shortcut for saving Plans and Records across the Inspector
- **Plan/Record suggestion history separated** — Title suggestions for Plans and Records are now tracked independently, giving more relevant autocomplete results
- **Inspector menu streamlined** — Removed unnecessary menu items from Plan Inspector and integrated the Cmd+Enter shortcut indicator

## Bug Fixes

- **Inspector close button delay fixed** — Resolved a lag when closing the Inspector by adopting a fire-and-forget pattern for save operations

## Security & Infrastructure

- **RLS policy vulnerabilities fixed** — Patched Row Level Security policies on 3 tables
- **Test API endpoints removed** — Removed test endpoints that were exposed in the production environment
- **search_path hardened** — Fixed `increment_ai_usage` function to use a fixed `search_path`
- **Logging fixed** — Error and warn logs now output correctly in production
- **SEO fix** — Corrected robots.txt domain to dayopt.app
- **Legal links** — Changed legal page links to absolute URLs pointing to the web side
- **GDPR compliance** — Restored cookie consent banner for Sentry
- **PWA icons** — Added missing PWA icons (192px, 512px, apple-touch-icon)
