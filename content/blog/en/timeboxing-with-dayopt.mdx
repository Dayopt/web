# 5 Practical Timeboxing Tips with Dayopt

To-do lists tell you *what* to do. Timeboxing tells you *when* and *for how long*. By placing each task into a specific time slot on your calendar, you transform vague intentions into concrete commitments. Here are five tips to make timeboxing work for you with Dayopt.

## 1. Start with Your Most Important Task

Don't fill your calendar from 9 AM onward. Instead, identify the one task that matters most today and timebox it first. In Dayopt, press `N` to create a Plan, give it a clear title, and drag it to the time slot where you have the most energy.

The rest of your day builds around this anchor.

## 2. Use Realistic Durations

A common mistake is scheduling 4-hour blocks for focused work. Most people can sustain deep focus for 60-90 minutes at a time.

| Task Type | Suggested Duration |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Deep focus work | 60-90 minutes |
| Meetings | 25 or 50 minutes |
| Email / messages | 30 minutes |
| Quick tasks | 15 minutes |

In Dayopt, drag the bottom edge of a Plan to resize it. You'll quickly develop a feel for how long things actually take.

## 3. Leave Buffer Time

Back-to-back timeboxes lead to burnout and schedule collapse. Leave 15-30 minutes between blocks for transitions, unexpected tasks, and mental breaks.

When Dayopt's "+" button auto-creates a Plan, it finds the next available slot — already accounting for your existing Plans. Use this as a quick way to fill gaps without over-scheduling.

## 4. Complete Plans and Create Records

The magic of timeboxing isn't just planning — it's comparing your plan to reality. When you finish a task, use **"Complete + Create Record"** in Dayopt's Inspector. This creates a Record linked to your Plan, capturing how you actually spent the time.

Over time, you'll notice patterns: tasks that always take longer than planned, times of day when you're most productive, and activities that consume more time than you realized.

## 5. Set Up Recurring Plans for Routines

Daily routines shouldn't require daily planning. Set up recurring Plans for activities you do regularly:

- **Weekday mornings**: Planning session (15 min)
- **Every Friday**: Weekly review (30 min)
- **Daily**: Email triage (30 min)

In Dayopt, click the repeat icon in the Inspector and choose a preset or create a custom schedule. Your routine appears automatically on future days.

## Getting Started

Timeboxing doesn't require perfection. Start with just 3-4 timeboxes per day. As the habit builds, you'll naturally expand to cover more of your schedule.

The key insight: **a partially followed timebox is still more effective than no plan at all.** Even when things don't go as planned, you'll learn something about how you spend your time.

Ready to try it? Open Dayopt, press `N`, and create your first Plan.
